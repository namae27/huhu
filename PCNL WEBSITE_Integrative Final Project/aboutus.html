                </div>
                <p class="sub-heading">Philippine College of Northwestern Luzon (PCNL) is a private, non-sectarian college in Agoo, La Union. It offers four-year undergraduate programs and also technical-vocational programs that can be completed in less than a year. The bachelor's degree programs available are in Elementary and Secondary Education, Information Technology, Criminology, Accountancy, and Business Administration. The TVET programs offered by TESDA are Computer Hardware Servicing, Housekeeping, and Programming, all leading to a National Certificate (NC).</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">The intense demands of our globalized world necessitate a competitive labor force, cultivated through the development of highly skilled and well-educated human resources. Recognizing this imperative, all learning institutions must strive to unlock their students' full potential, producing graduates capable of thriving in the global arena. It was with this vision in mind that a higher education institution (HEI) was conceived. A survey, employing random sampling of parents from La Union and the northern and western municipalities of Pangasinan areas with a significant pool of prospective students from elementary and secondary schools indicated a strong demand for such an institution.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">Following the initial organizational meeting of its founders, the entity was formally named the Philippine College of Northwestern Luzon (PCNL). Its articles of incorporation and by-laws were duly approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Baguio Extension Office on February 20, 2007.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">The dedicated group meticulously prepared all requirements set forth by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), outlining the prospective academic programs tailored to the region's needs. These included the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA), Bachelor of Science in Accountancy (BSA), Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSE), Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEE), and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). While awaiting CHED's approval for these degree programs, the Board of Trustees, comprising nine members from the fifteen incorporators, proactively explored offering short-term vocational courses accredited by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). Following a thorough evaluation by the TESDA technical panel, PCNL was granted permission to offer four short-term programs: Computer Hardware Servicing NC II, Computer Programming NC IV, PC Operation NC II, and Tourism Housekeeping NC II. These programs commenced in the first semester of the 2007-2008 academic year.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">In February 2008, CHED granted initial approval for the BSBA and BSA programs, which were offered in the first semester of the 2008-2009 academic year. The subsequent year saw the approval of the BSE and BEE programs, followed by the BSIT and Criminology programs. The Teacher Education Programs are specifically designed to cultivate proficient educators who will build a strong foundation of literacy and numeracy essential for the basic education system. The BSBA program, with its specializations in Financial Management and Human Resources Development and Management (HRDM), is envisioned as a vital contributor to business and entrepreneurial endeavors – the very building blocks of an industrialized economy – by fostering a broad global perspective and a comprehensive understanding of the operational context of business enterprises. The BSIT program, particularly its Computer Programming specialization, aims to drive innovation in new technologies, creating a more efficient and accessible world. The Criminology program is dedicated to upholding peace and order within the growing community and the nation. The BSA program, along with its specialized areas, seeks to enhance and improve the banking sector. Complementing these degree programs, the TESDA courses provide crucial skills training, further developing students' potential and offering them pathways to pursue and complete a college degree.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading"> PCNL is projected to be both socially beneficial and economically sustainable. Its academic programs will increase the number of professionals and technically skilled individuals in the region, contributing significantly to the human resource pool for both local and international employment opportunities. Furthermore, PCNL is expected to stimulate the development of more industries, generating additional employment and consequently enhancing the regional economy and the overall quality of life for its people.</p>
